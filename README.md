 What does it do?
----------------------------
 + **Uglifier** is a program designed to scramble `HTML` code, effectively enhancing its security and making it exceptionally challenging to follow.
 + It was developed to prevent people `shamelessly` copying your website. Yeah it's pretty annoying sometimes..

 Installation
-------------

You can easily install and run the source code, but make sure you have the libraries in place for it to work:
```bash
pip install customtkinter
```
> Or you can install the compiled version of Uglifier.

Warning
-------------
This project is still being developed, and as of now it can cause errors. I have also just started working on it so the code might be a bit messy and weird.
